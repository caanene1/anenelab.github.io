Collaborative support is suitable for funded long-term project grants, departments, 
reserch centers or groups that want biostatistics support on standby.
This support can be used for proposal development, R&D project execution, report preparation, 
analysis, training or participation in methological reviews.
We offer you a free meeting to establish the collaboration plan and associated fee.
