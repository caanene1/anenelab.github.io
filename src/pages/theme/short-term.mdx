Short-term support is suitable for projects with well-defined questions and datasets. 
*The majority of our clients use this option.* Here, we offer you a free meeting to describe the project requirments. 
We then determine the workload and duration, and present you with a fee proposal.

#### Common short-term activities include: 
- developing study designs
- calculating sample size and power
- developing an analysis plan
- performing statistical analysis on a prepared dataset
- preparing abstracts or other presentations
