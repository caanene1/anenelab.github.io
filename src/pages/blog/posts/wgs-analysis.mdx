 The analysis process typically consists of several key steps, including sample preparation, 
 sequencing, quality control, alignment, quantification, and downstream analysis, which only process one type of data.'

Whole genome sequencing (WGS)  provides a high-resolution view of an organism's genetic material, 
enabling the identification of genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
 insertions, deletions, copy number variations (CNVs), and structural variations (SVs).

The WGS analysis process typically involves several key steps, including sample preparation, 
sequencing, quality control, assembly, variant calling, and annotation.

- **Sample Preparation**: WGS starts with the preparation of DNA from cells or tissue. This can be
 performed using standard DNA extraction methods, such as phenol-chloroform extraction or commercial
  kits. The DNA is then subjected to quality control, which includes assessment of DNA concentration,
   purity, and integrity. 

- **Sequencing**: After the DNA has been prepared, it is subjected to high-throughput sequencing. 
The most common sequencing platforms for WGS are **Illumina**, **PacBio**, and **Oxford Nanopore**. 

- **Quality Control**: After sequencing, quality control steps are performed to assess the quality 
of the sequencing data and to remove low-quality reads and contaminants. Tools such as **FastQC**
and **Qualimap** can be used for this purpose.  

- **Alignment/Assembly**: The next step is to align the sequencing reads to a reference genome or 
assemble the sequencing reads into a contiguous representation of the 
genome, known as a genome assembly. Popular alignment tools for DNA-Seq include **BWA** and **Bowtie2**. 
Assembly requires the use of specialized software, such as **SPAdes**,
or **SOAPdenovo**. The quality of the assembly is assessed using tools such as **BUSCO** and **QUAST**. 

- **Variant Calling**: Once the genome assembly has been generated, the next step is to call variants, 
including SNPs, indels, CNVs, and SVs. Variant calling can be performed using a variety of tools, 
including **GATK**, **Samtools**, and **VarScan**. 

- **Annotation**: After variant calling, the variants can be annotated, which involves the assignment of 
functional information to the variants. Annotation can be performed using tools such as **ANNOVAR**, 
*8snpEff**, and **MAKER**. 

WGS requires a strong understanding of molecular biology, genetics, and computational biology, 
and is typically performed by trained professionals with expertise in these areas.
