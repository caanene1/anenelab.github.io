As medical technology continues to evolve, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in disease prognosis
 has become increasingly relevant. AI can decipher complex patterns in medical data, 
 allowing clinicians to make more informed decisions about patient care. Multimodal 
 AI integrates multiple data sources, such as imaging, genomics, and clinical data, 
 to predict disease progression and treatment outcomes. By combining these different 
 types of data, multimodal AI can better capture the various mechanisms of disease progression. 
 This approach is essential in complex diseases, such as cancer, where multiple factors contribute 
 to disease progression and treatment outcomes.

## Advantages
One example of prognostic multimodal AI is the use of imaging and genomics data to predict the 
progression of cancer. Advanced imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
and computed tomography (CT) scans, can capture the physiological changes associated with 
cancer progression. Meanwhile, genomics data provides information about the underlying 
oncogenic drivers. Another example is the use of clinical and genomics data to predict the 
progression of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Clinical data, 
such as patient symptoms and medical history, can provide important information about the 
progression of these diseases. In contrast, genomics data indicate the genetic factors 
contributing to the deterioration of neurological functions. By integrating these two types 
of data, multimodal AI algorithms can make more accurate predictions about the progression of 
the disease. 

In addition to its ability to integrate multiple data sources, predictive multimodal AI also has 
the advantage of handling high-dimensional and complex data. This is especially important in medical
 research, where large amounts of data are generated from multiple sources.

## Current challenges
Despite its many advantages, there are some challenges associated with the use of multimodal AI in 
disease prognosis. 
- One of the main challenges is the availability of high-quality data from multiple
 sources. To make accurate predictions, multimodal AI algorithms need to be trained on high-quality
  data that is representative of the patient population. This requires the development of robust data
   collection and management systems, as well as the development of data cleaning and normalization 
   techniques. 
   
- Another challenge is the need for robust and transparent evaluation methods. Here, 
   clinical utility depends on rigorous and transparent evaluation methods that account for the 
   uncertainty and variability in the data. This requires the development of novel evaluation methods 
   that can handle the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data.

## Future
While there are still challenges to be overcome, the continued development and application of 
multimodal AI in disease prognosis holds great promise for the future of medical research. 
We expect future models to be more accurate in predicting the progression of the disease and 
the potential effectiveness of different treatment options compared to the current 
unimodal AI models.
